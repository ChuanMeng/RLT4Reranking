Supplementary materials for the paper titled "_Ranked List Truncation: From Retrieval to Re-ranking_". 

In this paper, we reproduce a comprehensive ranked list truncation (RLT) methods, originally designed for optimizing retrieval, in a "retrieve-then-re-rank" setup; we seek to examine to what extent established findings on RLT for retrieval are generalizable to the ``retrieve-then-re-rank'' setup.

This repository is structured into five distinct parts:
1. Data preparation,
2. Feature generation,
3. Train and infer RLT methods,
4. Evaluation.

## 1. Data preparation

### Fetch retrieved list

### Fetch re-ranked lists

## 2. Feature generation

## 3. Train and infer RLT methods

## 4. Evaluation
