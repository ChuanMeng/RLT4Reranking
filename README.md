Supplementary materials for the paper titled "Ranked List Truncation: From Retrieval to Re-ranking". 

In this paper, we reproduce a comprehensive ranked list truncation (RLT) methods, originally designed for optimizing retrieval, in a "retrieve-then-re-rank" setup; we seek to examine to what extent established findings on RLT for retrieval are generalizable to the ``retrieve-then-re-rank'' setup.
